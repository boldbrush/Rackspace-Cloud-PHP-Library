 Rackspace Cloud PHP Library
-----------------------------

The Rackspace Cloud has released an API for their Cloud Servers which you can
find here:
  http://www.rackspacecloud.com/cloud_hosting_products/servers/api
The Cloud Server API is currently in beta, and does not have any libraries
available to simplify making calls, so I have created this PHP one.

This is strictly for PHP5 since PHP4 should be forgotten forever.

The API has some poorly written documentation, but it is still useful. You can
find it at this address:
  http://docs.rackspacecloud.com/servers/api/cs-devguide-latest.pdf

This library is documented using PHPDoc.

I welcome any other developers to join this project.
